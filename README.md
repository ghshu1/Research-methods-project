# Introduction-to-research-methods-project

## General information
This project will be about the use of gendered and gender neutral pronouns in English literature. Gendered pronouns are he, she, his, her, etc. This project will study the usage of gendered/neutral pronouns throughout the years. Literature is always changing throughout the years, and English literature is no different. The frequency of gendered and neutral pronouns may also have changed. Two works will be selected from the Project Gutenberg corpus, one an English work from the 1900s, the other an English work from the 2000s.

## Background information
The usage of gendered pronouns can be influenced by the view our society has on genders. The way authors depict these genders in various literature can be representative of the general public’s view of genders. Historically, English books often only used male or female pronouns. However, in recent years there has been a focus on gender-neutral pronouns. These changes will be studied through Project Gutenburg’s corpus. If there has been a significant shift in the usage of these pronouns, it may provide insight into society’s attitudes towards genders, and how they change over time.

## Reserach question and hypothesis
Research question: Has the usage of gendered and neutral pronouns changed over time in English literature?

Hypothesis: The usage of neutral pronouns is increasing over time compared to gendered pronouns in English literature.

Independent Variable: Time period (work from 1900s, work from 2000s)

Dependent Variable: Percentage of gendered pronouns out of the total amount of pronouns used

| Independent variable | Percentage of gendered pronouns |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Work from 1900s      | 0 %                             |
| Work from 2000s      | 0 %                             |

## Method 
1. Pick an English book from the Project Gutenberg corpus from the 1900s and the 2000s.  
2. Count the frequency of gendered/neutral pronouns in each book.  
3. Count the total number of pronouns in each book.  
4. Get the relative frequency of gendered/neutral pronouns in each book.
